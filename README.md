# fast-push
Git add commit and push your files with `fpush` command

Tired of always have to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`? Be lazy and super fast with `fpush` command, which does everything for you. 

## Install

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/fast-push.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-push)

```
$ npm install -g fast-push
```

## Usage

``` bash
  $ fpush "Super fast commit!"
```

Instead of:

``` bash
  $ git add --all
  $ git commit -m "[develop]Super fast commit!"
  $ git push origin develop
```

## Output

All your files are added, committed and pushed on your current branch.

## Note

In order to be more effective, `fast-push` works with no external dependecies.
